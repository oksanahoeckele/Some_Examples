Assignment
Who_Likes_to_Riot

For this assignment I created a class variable named @@everyone and set it equal to an empty array.  The save method also printed @@everyone out to the console, so I could see all the people that were in my storage.  

Then I defined a class method called riot. When riot was called on the Person class, I observed a string “The people are rising up!” in the console.

And finally, I adjusted the riot method to print out all the names of the people who were rioting.

Assignment
Egyptian_Pyramids

I wrote a program that builds a pyramid.
If you call the program like this: ruby pyramid.rb 6
It should print out a pyramid 6 rows tall.
